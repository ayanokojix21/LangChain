I went to the park yesterday. It was a sunny day, birds were flying in the sky and kids was playing all around. 
There was a man sitting on a bench reading a book, he look very focused. 
I decided to sit under a tree and eat some chips that I bought from the shop near by.
After some times, I saw a dog chasing a squirell. The dog barked loudly and made many peoples looked. 
Some childrens were scared, but other laughed and enjoyed the scene. The dog eventually got tired and sit near its owner, panting heavily.
At evening, I started going home. The road were little busy and I almost get hit by a bicyclist who don't saw me. 
Thankfully I moved quickly. When I reach home, I felt tired but happy. The day was long but good.
